# AI Routing & UX Playbook (Production-Ready)

Last Updated: 2025-10-10
Status: Consolidated and Implementation-Ready

Purpose: This playbook consolidates and supersedes the following: docs/Unified_AI_Implementation_and_UX_Flow.md, docs/Operations_Runbook_Current_vs_Future.md, and all items in docs/archived/*. It clearly differentiates what is CURRENT vs RECOMMENDED, and integrates the implementation guide, strategy, and UX flow in one place.

— This document is now the single source of truth for AI routing, RAG, UX behavior, and rollout. —

## 1) Models & Routing

### CURRENT (as of 2025-10-10)

**Model Assignments:**
- Default model: google/gemini-2.5-flash (balanced performance/cost)
- Vision + reasoning: google/gemini-2.5-pro (multimodal capabilities)
- Heavy analytical/comparatives: gemini-2.5-pro; optionally openai/gpt-5 for premium cases
- Fast summaries/classification: gemini-2.5-flash-lite (optimized for speed)
- Image generation: google/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview

**Task-Specific Model Selection:**
- General conversation: gemini-2.5-flash
- Domain-specific (healthcare/clinical): gemini-2.5-pro (better accuracy)
- Code generation: gemini-2.5-flash (adequate for most cases)
- Creative writing: gemini-2.5-pro (better nuance)
- Analytical reasoning: openai/gpt-5 or gemini-2.5-pro
- Multilingual: All Gemini models support multilingual

**Context Window Management:**
- Gemini models: Up to 2M tokens (practical limit: use model defaults)
- Current implementation: Rolling trimmed history without summarization
- No adaptive context window yet

**Model Switching Logic Priority:**
1. User explicit selection (always honored)
2. Domain requirement (healthcare → Pro; tech → Flash)
3. Query complexity & cost target
4. Availability/rate-limit status
5. Default fallback: gemini-2.5-flash

**Integration:**
- Single system prompt enforced in Edge Function (ai-universal-processor)
- All requests through Lovable AI Gateway
- Streaming SSE supported; no secrets on client

### RECOMMENDED (Target)

**Intelligent Model Selection:**
- Auto-upshift when confidence < threshold (e.g., 0.7)
- Task-specific routing matrix (code → Flash, creative → Pro, analysis → GPT-5)
- Cost-aware SLM fallback for high-volume FAQ
- Multi-model orchestration for comparison scenarios

**Context & Memory:**
- Adaptive context window with summarized history and deduped context
- Context window optimization per model type
- Better reasoning with extended context for complex queries

**Infrastructure:**
- Multi-region endpoints and provider redundancy for availability
- Central model map with versioning (created_at/updated_at)
- Fallback chains: Primary → Secondary → Lite

**Consistency:**
- Unified system prompt across models
- Tone and personality alignment
- Response format standardization

## 2) Context, Memory, and Tokens

### CURRENT
- Use model defaults; maintain rolling trimmed history
- Fallback path on error/latency: downgrade to flash-lite with notice
- Fixed 4000 token limit (not adaptive)

### RECOMMENDED
- Adaptive windowing (summaries of history, deduped context)
- Token-aware routing caps by plan tier
- Dynamic token allocation:
  - Simple queries: 1500 tokens
  - Medium queries: 3000 tokens
  - Complex queries: 6000 tokens
- Context compression for large conversations

## 3) Operational Factors

### CURRENT

## 7) UX Flow & Multi-Model Intelligence (Single Source)

### CURRENT

**Key Components:**
- PublicGenieInterface (orchestration)
- SplitScreenRenderer (optional multi-model) - NOT YET OPTIMIZED
- RichResponseRenderer (formatting)
- TopicSuggestionPopover + context detection
- Model badge showing which model was used

**Split-Screen Behavior (Basic):**
- `enableMultiModelComparison` flag → shows side-by-side responses
- User can compare Flash vs Pro vs GPT-5 after initial response
- No real-time constraint prioritization yet
- No automatic response format selection

**Constraint Prioritization (Current):**
- Simple priority: User Selection > Domain > Complexity > Default
- No intelligent conflict resolution
- No multi-constraint decision tree
- Example: User selects "Healthcare" + "Vision" + "Flash Lite" → No smart handling, just picks Flash Lite

**Model Selection Flow:**

1. **User Selects Model + AI Analyzes Query:**
   - ✅ **Match**: Proceed silently with model badge confirmation
   - 💡 **Minor difference**: Gentle toast suggestion, auto-proceed with user choice
   - ⚠️ **Major difference**: Blocking dialog requiring approval (e.g., image on non-vision model)
   - 🤖 **No selection**: AI chooses automatically, badge shows choice + "Why?" tooltip

2. **Current Scenarios:**
   - No model selected → AI recommends silently; badge shows choice + "Why"
   - Minor mismatch (e.g., using Flash for heavy reasoning) → gentle toast: "Pro recommended for complex analysis" + continue
   - Major mismatch (e.g., image on Flash Lite) → blocking dialog: "Flash Lite doesn't support images. Switch to Gemini Pro?"
   - Match → silent proceed with badge

**User Control (Basic):**
- Can manually select any model
- Can override AI recommendations
- No automation level settings yet
- No learning from user choices yet

**Transparency (Basic):**
- Model badge shows which model was used
- No cost/token metrics displayed yet
- No "Why this model?" reasoning visible by default
- No post-response comparison option

### RECOMMENDED

**Enhanced Split-Screen with Intelligent Response Routing:**

Split-screen becomes an intelligent comparison and validation tool:

1. **Real-Time Split-Screen (Advanced):**
   - Left pane: User-selected or AI-recommended primary model
   - Right pane: Alternative model for comparison (optional)
   - Show cost, speed, quality differences side-by-side
   - User can promote either response to "final answer"

2. **Auto-Trigger Split-Screen:**
   - When user selects constraints that conflict (e.g., "Healthcare" + "Vision" + "Fast response")
   - When AI confidence is low (<70%)
   - When cost difference is significant (>50%)
   - When user is in "learning mode"

**Constraint Prioritization Matrix (RECOMMENDED):**

When user selects multiple constraints (LLM type, domain, capabilities), prioritize as follows:

| Priority | Constraint Type | Example | Override Logic |
|----------|----------------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | **Required Capabilities** | Vision, Image Analysis | BLOCKS incompatible models |
| 2 | **Domain Context** | Healthcare, Clinical, Research | STRONG preference for domain-specific models |
| 3 | **User Explicit Selection** | "Use GPT-5" | HONORED unless capability conflict (Priority 1) |
| 4 | **Performance Requirements** | Fast, Low-Cost | SUGGESTS alternatives, doesn't block |
| 5 | **Default/Fallback** | gemini-2.5-flash | APPLIES when no other constraints |

**Constraint Resolution Decision Tree:**

```
User Input: "Analyze this medical scan" + Context: Healthcare + Selection: Flash Lite
     ↓
Step 1: Required Capabilities Check
     ↓
   Vision Required? → YES
   Flash Lite supports vision? → NO
     ↓
❌ BLOCK: Flash Lite incompatible
     ↓
Step 2: Domain Context Check
     ↓
   Domain: Healthcare → Prefer Pro (better medical accuracy)
     ↓
Step 3: User Selection Check
     ↓
   User selected Flash Lite → Conflict with Step 1 & 2
     ↓
Step 4: Resolution
     ↓
⚠️ Blocking Dialog:
"Flash Lite doesn't support vision and is suboptimal for healthcare.
 RECOMMENDED: Gemini Pro
 - Vision: ✅  Healthcare accuracy: ✅  Cost: $0.02
 ALTERNATIVE: Gemini Flash (vision: ✅, cost: $0.01, accuracy: moderate)
 
 Proceed with Pro? [Yes] [Use Flash] [Cancel]"
```

**Enhanced Model Selection Flow:**

```
User Input → [Parse All Constraints]
     ↓
Required Capabilities (Vision/RAG/Multi-model)?
     ↓ YES                           ↓ NO
Filter compatible models        All models available
     ↓                           ↓
Domain Context (Healthcare/Tech/Research)?
     ↓ YES                           ↓ NO
Prefer domain-optimized         General models OK
     ↓                           ↓
User Explicit Selection?
     ↓ YES                           ↓ NO
Check compatibility             AI Auto-Select
     ↓                           ↓
Compatible? → Proceed           Show reasoning badge
Not compatible? → Block dialog
     ↓
[Decision Tree Outcome]
```

**Decision Tree for User-Selected Models:**

| Scenario | AI Recommendation | User Selection | Action | UI Feedback |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| ✅ Match | Flash | Flash | Proceed silently | Green badge: "Gemini Flash (optimal)" |
| 💡 Minor Diff | Pro | Flash | Toast + Auto-proceed | Orange toast: "Pro recommended for better results. Continuing with Flash..." |
| ⚠️ Major Diff | Pro (vision) | Flash Lite | Block + Require approval | Dialog: "Flash Lite doesn't support images. Switch to Pro?" |
| 🤖 No Selection | - | - | AI auto-selects | Badge: "Gemini Flash (auto-selected)" + "Why?" tooltip |

**User Automation Control (Settings):**

Three automation levels users can configure:

1. **Manual Mode** (User always chooses):
   - No AI suggestions
   - User picks model every time
   - AI shows post-response what it would have chosen

2. **Smart Assist** (Default - AI suggests, user controls):
   - AI analyzes and suggests
   - Gentle toasts for minor differences
   - Blocking dialogs for major mismatches
   - User can override any suggestion
   - System learns from overrides

3. **Auto-Optimize** (AI chooses, user monitors):
   - AI auto-selects optimal model
   - Silent model switching
   - Badge shows reasoning
   - User can manually override on next query
   - System learns from manual overrides

**System Learning (Recommended):**
- Track user model preferences per query type
- Learn patterns: "User prefers Pro for medical queries despite Flash being suggested"
- Adjust AI suggestions based on user history
- Privacy: Learning stored per-user session only

**Enhanced Transparency (Every Response):**

## 9) Implementation Guide (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: Query Intelligence (Week 1-2)
**Goal:** Understand what users are asking

**Files to Create:**
- `supabase/functions/ai-query-analyzer/index.ts` - Analyzes complexity, domain, intent, required capabilities
- `src/services/queryAnalysisService.ts` - Frontend query preprocessing
- `src/types/aiQuery.ts` - Type definitions

**Features:**
1. Intent classification (research, clinical, general, technical)
2. Domain detection (healthcare, tech, multi-domain)
3. Complexity scoring (0-100)
4. Required capabilities detection (vision, RAG, multi-model)
5. Cost estimation

**No user-facing changes** - collect data and log analysis results only.

### Phase 2: Model Selection Enhancement (Week 2-3)
**Goal:** Smart routing with user control and transparency

**Files to Modify:**
- `supabase/functions/ai-universal-processor/index.ts` - Add intelligent routing with comparison logic
- `src/components/public-genie/ModelSelectionDialog.tsx` - Create blocking dialog for major mismatches
- `src/components/public-genie/ModelBadge.tsx` - Enhanced badge with reasoning tooltip

**Decision Matrix Implementation:**
```typescript
interface ModelComparisonResult {
  userChoice: string;
  aiRecommendation: string;
  matchLevel: 'perfect' | 'minor' | 'major';
  reasoning: string;
  action: 'proceed' | 'suggest' | 'block';
}

function compareUserVsAIChoice(
  userModel: string | undefined,
  aiAnalysis: QueryAnalysis
): ModelComparisonResult {
  // Implementation of match/minor/major logic
}
```

**UX Components:**
- ✅ Match: Silent proceed with green badge
- 💡 Minor: Toast with suggestion, auto-proceed
- ⚠️ Major: Blocking dialog requiring approval
- 🤖 No selection: Auto-select with reasoning badge

**Feature flag:** `enableSmartRouting=false` (test internally first)

### Phase 2.5: Multi-Model & RAG Decision Logic (Week 3)
**Goal:** Intelligent decision when to use single vs multi-model with RAG/Knowledge Base

**Files to Create:**
- `src/utils/multiModelDecisionEngine.ts` - Logic for single vs multi-model responses
- `src/types/modelDecision.ts` - Decision types and interfaces

**Decision Logic: Single vs Multi-Model Response**

```typescript
interface ResponseStrategy {
  mode: 'single' | 'multi-model' | 'ensemble';
  models: string[];
  useRAG: boolean;
  useKnowledgeBase: boolean;
  reasoning: string;
}

function determineResponseStrategy(
  query: string,
  userConstraints: UserConstraints,
  context: ConversationContext
): ResponseStrategy {
  // Priority 1: Required capabilities filter
  const compatibleModels = filterByCapabilities(userConstraints);
  
  // Priority 2: Domain context influences choice
  const domainOptimal = getDomainOptimalModels(userConstraints.domain);
  
  // Priority 3: Complexity determines single vs multi
  const complexity = analyzeComplexity(query);
  
  if (complexity.requiresComparison || userConstraints.showComparison) {
    return {
      mode: 'multi-model',
      models: [domainOptimal.primary, domainOptimal.alternative],
      useRAG: shouldUseRAG(query, context),
      useKnowledgeBase: shouldUseKnowledgeBase(userConstraints.domain),
      reasoning: 'Comparison requested or high complexity detected'
    };
  }
  
  if (complexity.requiresEnsemble) {
    return {
      mode: 'ensemble',
      models: [domainOptimal.primary, 'gemini-2.5-flash'], // Primary + Fast
      useRAG: true,
      useKnowledgeBase: true,
      reasoning: 'Combining multiple models for validation'
    };
  }
  
  return {
    mode: 'single',
    models: [domainOptimal.primary],
    useRAG: shouldUseRAG(query, context),
    useKnowledgeBase: shouldUseKnowledgeBase(userConstraints.domain),
    reasoning: 'Single model sufficient for query'
  };
}
```

**RAG & Knowledge Base Priority:**

```typescript
// Determine when to use RAG vs Knowledge Base vs Both
function shouldUseRAG(query: string, context: ConversationContext): boolean {
  // Use RAG when:
  // - Query mentions specific facts, citations, research
  // - Context indicates user wants sources
  // - Domain is scientific/research
  return (
    query.includes('research') ||
    query.includes('study') ||
    query.includes('citation') ||
    context.domain === 'research' ||
    context.requiresSources
  );
}

function shouldUseKnowledgeBase(domain: string): boolean {
  // Use Knowledge Base when:
  // - Domain is healthcare, clinical, or technology
  // - User has selected domain context
  return ['healthcare', 'clinical', 'technology', 'research'].includes(domain);
}

function getCombinedStrategy(
  query: string,
  domain: string,
  context: ConversationContext
): { useRAG: boolean; useKnowledgeBase: boolean; priority: string } {
  const ragNeeded = shouldUseRAG(query, context);
  const kbNeeded = shouldUseKnowledgeBase(domain);
  
  if (ragNeeded && kbNeeded) {
    return {
      useRAG: true,
      useKnowledgeBase: true,
      priority: 'RAG first, then KB supplement' // RAG has precedence for sources
    };
  }
  
  if (ragNeeded) {
    return { useRAG: true, useKnowledgeBase: false, priority: 'RAG only' };
  }
  
  if (kbNeeded) {
    return { useRAG: false, useKnowledgeBase: true, priority: 'KB only' };
  }
  
  return { useRAG: false, useKnowledgeBase: false, priority: 'Model only' };
}
```

**Example Decision Trees:**

**Scenario 1: User selects "Healthcare" + "Vision" + "Fast"**
```
Step 1: Filter by capabilities → Vision required → Filter: [Pro, GPT-5]
Step 2: Domain priority → Healthcare → Prefer: Pro (domain-optimized)
Step 3: Performance → Fast requested → Conflict!
Step 4: Resolution → 
  PRIMARY: Gemini Pro (domain + vision)
  TOAST: "Pro recommended for healthcare image analysis. Flash doesn't support vision. Estimated: 2.3s"
  MODE: Single model + Knowledge Base (healthcare context)
```

**Scenario 2: User asks "Compare research studies on X"**
```
Step 1: Capabilities → Text only → All models OK
Step 2: Domain → Research → Use RAG + Knowledge Base
Step 3: Intent → "Compare" keyword → Multi-model mode
Step 4: Resolution →
  PRIMARY: Gemini Pro (research analysis)
  SECONDARY: GPT-5 (alternative perspective)
  MODE: Multi-model + RAG (priority) + KB (supplement)
  SPLIT-SCREEN: Show both responses side-by-side
  REASONING: "Comparison mode: Pro for depth, GPT-5 for alternative analysis"
```

**Scenario 3: User selects "Clinical" + "Small Language Model"**
```
Step 1: Capabilities → Text only → SLM compatible
Step 2: Domain → Clinical → Conflict! (Clinical requires accuracy, SLM may be insufficient)
Step 3: Resolution →
  ⚠️ WARNING DIALOG:
  "Small Language Models may not provide clinical-grade accuracy.
   RECOMMENDED: Gemini Pro for clinical queries
   ALTERNATIVE: Gemini Flash (moderate accuracy, lower cost)
   CONTINUE with SLM? (Not recommended) [Switch to Pro] [Use Flash] [Continue anyway]"
```

**Token Optimization Decision Matrix:**

|--------|-----------|-------|------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Healthcare | Simple | Flash | 2000 | 8000 | None | $0.008 |

**Context Preservation Strategies:**

```typescript
// Maintain context quality while optimizing tokens
function maintainContextQuality(
  query: string,
  domain: string,
  history: Message[],
  allocation: TokenAllocation
): { messages: Message[], preserved: string[], dropped: string[] } {
  
  const critical = extractCriticalContext(query, history, domain);
  const preserved = [];
  const dropped = [];
  
  // Always preserve:
  // 1. System prompt
  // 2. Critical domain context (e.g., patient info for clinical)
  // 3. Last 3 user messages
  // 4. Any referenced prior responses
  
  let tokenBudget = allocation.contextWindow;
  
  // Reserve tokens for query and response
  tokenBudget -= estimateTokens(query);
  tokenBudget -= allocation.maxTokens; // Reserve for response
  
  // Add critical context first
  for (const msg of critical) {
    const tokens = estimateTokens(msg.content);
    if (tokenBudget - tokens > 0) {
      preserved.push(msg.id);
      tokenBudget -= tokens;
    } else {
      dropped.push(msg.id);
    }
  }
  
  // Add recent history
  for (let i = history.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (preserved.includes(history[i].id)) continue;
    const tokens = estimateTokens(history[i].content);
    if (tokenBudget - tokens > 0) {
      preserved.push(history[i].id);
      tokenBudget -= tokens;
    } else {
      dropped.push(history[i].id);
    }
  }
  
  return {
    messages: history.filter(m => preserved.includes(m.id)),
    preserved,
    dropped
  };
}
```

### Phase 5.6: Response Format Intelligence (Week 6)
**Goal:** Automatically determine optimal response format based on query type and context

**Files to Create:**
- `src/utils/responseFormatSelector.ts` - Logic to determine response format
- `src/components/public-genie/AdaptiveResponseRenderer.tsx` - Dynamic format rendering

**Response Format Selection Logic:**

```typescript
type ResponseFormat = 'text' | 'table' | 'image' | 'html' | 'video' | 'mixed';

interface FormatDecision {
  primary: ResponseFormat;
  fallback: ResponseFormat;
  reasoning: string;
  toolsRequired?: string[];
}

function determineResponseFormat(
  query: string,
  domain: string,
  context: ConversationContext
): FormatDecision {
  
  // Priority 1: Explicit format requests
  if (query.match(/show.*table|tabular|spreadsheet/i)) {
    return {
      primary: 'table',
      fallback: 'text',
      reasoning: 'User explicitly requested tabular format'
    };
  }
  
  if (query.match(/diagram|chart|visualiz|image|picture/i)) {
    return {
      primary: 'image',
      fallback: 'text',
      reasoning: 'User requested visual representation',
      toolsRequired: ['image-generation']
    };
  }
  
  if (query.match(/video|animation|demo/i)) {
    return {
      primary: 'video',
      fallback: 'image',
      reasoning: 'User requested video/animation',
      toolsRequired: ['video-generation'] // Future capability
    };
  }
  
  // Priority 2: Domain-specific patterns
  if (domain === 'research' && query.match(/compar|vs|versus|between/i)) {
    return {
      primary: 'table',
      fallback: 'text',
      reasoning: 'Research comparison best shown in table format'
    };
  }
  
  if (domain === 'healthcare' && query.match(/scan|image|x-ray|mri|ct/i)) {
    return {
      primary: 'image',
      fallback: 'mixed',
      reasoning: 'Medical imaging query requires visual + text',
      toolsRequired: ['vision-analysis']
    };
  }
  
  if (domain === 'clinical' && query.match(/timeline|progression|history/i)) {
    return {
      primary: 'html',
      fallback: 'table',
      reasoning: 'Clinical timeline best shown with interactive HTML'
    };
  }
  
  // Priority 3: Query intent analysis
  const intent = analyzeIntent(query);
  
  if (intent.type === 'comparison' && intent.entities > 2) {
    return {
      primary: 'table',
      fallback: 'text',
      reasoning: 'Multiple entity comparison optimal in table'
    };
  }
  
  if (intent.type === 'procedural' || intent.type === 'tutorial') {
    return {
      primary: 'html',
      fallback: 'text',
      reasoning: 'Step-by-step content works best with formatted HTML'
    };
  }
  
  // Default: text
  return {
    primary: 'text',
    fallback: 'text',
    reasoning: 'Standard text response sufficient'
  };
}
```

**Response Format by Domain (Reference Table):**

| Query Type | Domain | Optimal Format | Example Query | Why |
|-----------|--------|----------------|---------------|-----|
| Comparison | Research | Table | "Compare studies A vs B vs C" | Multi-column data |
| Imaging | Healthcare | Image + Text | "What does this MRI show?" | Visual analysis required |
| Timeline | Clinical | HTML/Interactive | "Patient progression over 6 months" | Temporal visualization |
| Data Analysis | Technology | Table + Chart | "Analyze these metrics" | Structured data view |
| Tutorial | General | HTML + Video | "How to configure X?" | Step-by-step with visuals |
| Q&A | All | Text | "What is X?" | Simple text sufficient |
| Statistical | Research | Table + Text | "Show statistical significance" | Numbers + interpretation |
| Diagnostic | Clinical | Mixed (Image + Table + Text) | "Review lab results and scan" | Multi-modal analysis |

**Format Rendering Strategy:**

```typescript
// Dynamic component selection based on format decision
function renderResponse(
  content: string,
  format: ResponseFormat,
  domain: string
) {
  switch (format) {
    case 'text':
      return <RichResponseRenderer content={content} />;
    
    case 'table':
      return <TableRenderer data={parseTableData(content)} domain={domain} />;
    
    case 'image':
      return (
        <ImageResponseRenderer 
          images={extractImages(content)} 
          caption={extractCaption(content)}
          domain={domain}
        />
      );
    
    case 'html':
      return (
        <InteractiveHTMLRenderer 
          html={sanitizeHTML(content)} 
          domain={domain}
          allowedTags={getDomainAllowedTags(domain)}
        />
      );
    
    case 'mixed':
      return (
        <MixedFormatRenderer 
          sections={parseMultiFormatContent(content)}
          domain={domain}
        />
      );
    
    default:
      return <RichResponseRenderer content={content} />;
  }
}
```

**Tool Calling for Format-Specific Responses:**

```typescript
// When response requires specific format, use tool calling
const formatTools = {
  'image-generation': {
    type: 'function',
    function: {
      name: 'generate_image',
      description: 'Generate an image based on description',
      parameters: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          description: { type: 'string' },
          style: { type: 'string', enum: ['medical', 'diagram', 'chart', 'realistic'] }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  'table-generation': {
    type: 'function',
    function: {
      name: 'generate_table',
      description: 'Generate a structured table',
      parameters: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          headers: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'string' } },
          rows: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'array' } }
        }
      }
    }
  }
};

// Include tools in AI request based on format decision
function buildAIRequest(
  query: string,
  formatDecision: FormatDecision,
  model: string
) {
  const baseRequest = {
    model,
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: query }]
  };
  
  if (formatDecision.toolsRequired) {
    baseRequest.tools = formatDecision.toolsRequired.map(
      tool => formatTools[tool]
    );
    baseRequest.tool_choice = 'auto';
  }
  
  return baseRequest;
}
```

**Feature flag:** `enableMultiModelComparison=true`, `enableAdaptiveFormatting=false` (Phase 6)

### Phase 6: System Learning (Week 6-7)
**Goal:** Learn from user choices to improve recommendations

**Files to Create:**
- Database table: `genie_model_choices` - Log user selections vs AI recommendations
- `src/utils/modelLearning.ts` - Pattern detection and preference learning

**Learning Logic:**
```typescript
interface UserModelPattern {
  user_id: string;
  query_type: string;
  ai_recommended: string;
  user_chose: string;
  frequency: number;
  last_seen: timestamp;
}

// Example: User always picks Pro for medical queries despite AI suggesting Flash
// → Future medical queries: AI auto-suggests Pro
```

**Privacy:**
- Learning stored per-user session only
- Can be disabled via `learn_from_choices` setting
- No cross-user learning (privacy-preserving)

**Feature flag:** `enableSystemLearning=false` (enable after testing)

### Client Integration Points
- Hook: `src/hooks/useUniversalAI.ts`
  - Add model comparison logic
  - Track user choices vs AI recommendations
  - Show model badge with reasoning
- Component: `PublicGenieInterface`
  - Integrate settings panel
  - Show metrics card
  - Handle blocking dialogs

### UX Instrumentation (Enhanced)
- Always show typing indicator while streaming
- Model badge with reasoning tooltip on every response
- Toast notifications for suggestions (minor mismatches)
- Blocking dialogs for major mismatches
- Metrics card (expandable/collapsible)
- Settings accessible from Genie UI
- Surface 429 → "Rate limit hit; retrying" toast with backoff
- Surface 402 → "Workspace credits required" toast
- On auto-fallback, show subtle notice badge

### Rollout Coordination
- Phase 1-2: Internal testing (baseline + smart routing)
- Phase 3-4: QA with user preferences + transparency
- Phase 5: Limited beta for multi-model comparison
- Phase 6: GA with all features, learning disabled by default
- See Ops Runbook (docs/Ops_Runbook_Genie.md) for SLO targets and monitoring

## 10) Strategy & Roadmap

### Near-term
- Keep Flash default, Pro for vision/complex; instrument routing rationale and latency
- Enable query intelligence with intent classification, domain detection, complexity scoring
- Add basic token optimization: dynamic allocation based on query complexity

### Mid-term
- Confidence-triggered upshift, token-aware caps, SLM pre-summarization
- RAG enhancement with semantic embeddings and confidence scoring
- Response format intelligence with auto-detection and tool calling
- Multi-model orchestration for side-by-side comparison

### Long-term
- Provider redundancy, multi-region endpoints for availability
- Adaptive memory with summarized history and deduped context
- Advanced cost optimization per tier
- Interactive response components (charts, diagrams, tables)

### Expected Performance Impact
| Metric | Current | After Optimization | Improvement |
|--------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Avg Response Time | 3-5s | 1.5-3s | 40-50% faster |
| Token Usage (Simple) | 4000 | 1500 | 62% reduction |
| Token Usage (Complex) | 4000 | 6000 | Better quality |
| RAG Accuracy | ~60% | ~85% | 25% improvement |
| Cost per Query (Simple) | $0.02 | $0.006 | 70% reduction |
| User Satisfaction | Baseline | +40% | Smarter responses |

## 11) Future-Proofing & Scalability

### CURRENT
- Single provider (Lovable AI Gateway)
- No model versioning strategy
- No abstraction layer for provider swapping
- Manual model updates in code

### RECOMMENDED

**Model Versioning Strategy:**
- Central model registry with versions and deprecation dates
- Gradual rollout: test new models on small cohort first
- Backward compatibility: maintain old model endpoints during migration
- Feature flags per model version

**Vendor Lock-in Mitigation:**
- Abstraction layer: unified interface for multiple providers
- Provider fallback chains (Lovable AI → OpenAI direct → Anthropic)
- Standard request/response envelope across providers
- Easy provider swapping via configuration

**Scalability:**
- Horizontal scaling: add models/providers without code changes
- Auto-scaling based on request volume
- Model load balancing across regions
- Caching layer for repeated queries

## 12) Appendices

### A. Model Priority (authoritative)
user_selection > domain_requirement > complexity/cost > availability > default

### B. Task-Specific Model Recommendations

| Task Type | Primary Model | Fallback | Reasoning |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| General conversation | gemini-2.5-flash | flash-lite | Balanced cost/quality |
| Healthcare/Clinical | gemini-2.5-pro | flash | Domain accuracy critical |
| Code generation | gemini-2.5-flash | gpt-5-mini | Adequate for most code |
| Creative writing | gemini-2.5-pro | gpt-5 | Nuance matters |
| Analytical reasoning | openai/gpt-5 | gemini-2.5-pro | Complex multi-step |
| Quick classification | gemini-2.5-flash-lite | flash | Speed over precision |
| Vision tasks | gemini-2.5-pro | N/A | Multimodal required |

### C. Context Window Guidelines

| Model | Max Context | Practical Limit | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | 2M tokens | 100K tokens | Long documents, extensive history |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | 1M tokens | 50K tokens | Standard conversations |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite | 1M tokens | 20K tokens | Quick queries |
| OpenAI GPT-5 | 200K tokens | 100K tokens | Complex reasoning |

### D. Error Surfacing (authoritative)
- 429 Too Many Requests → toast: "Rate limit hit; retrying"; auto-backoff
- 402 Payment Required → toast: "Workspace credits required"
- Model unavailable → silent fallback + subtle notice badge
- Confidence low → optional model switch suggestion
