# Comprehensive Guide to Drug Pricing Models & Insurance Coverage

## Overview
This guide explains the different pricing models used in the pharmaceutical industry and how they correlate to various insurance types and patient access programs.

## Pricing Models Explained

### 1. **WAC (Wholesale Acquisition Cost)**
**Definition:** The manufacturer's list price to wholesalers/distributors before any discounts or rebates.

**Key Points:**
- This is the "sticker price" of the drug
- Does NOT include rebates, discounts, or patient assistance
- Typically the highest price listed
- Used as the starting point for negotiations
- Often 20-40% higher than actual net prices paid

**Example:** Kymriah WAC = $475,000 (but actual prices paid are often lower after rebates)

**Who Pays WAC:**
- Uninsured patients (without assistance programs)
- Some cash-pay situations
- Starting point for insurance negotiations

---

### 2. **Government Pricing (340B/VA/Medicaid)**
**Definition:** Discounted prices required by federal law for certain healthcare providers and government programs.

**340B Drug Pricing Program:**
- Mandatory discounts (typically 20-50% off WAC)
- Hospitals/clinics serving low-income/uninsured patients
- Federal discount: Usually 40-50% off WAC
- Eligible entities: Safety-net hospitals, FQHCs, Ryan White clinics

**VA/DoD Pricing:**
- Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices
- Typically 24% discount from "non-federal average manufacturer price"
- Additional rebates bring effective discount to 40-60%
- Covers Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, and other federal facilities

**Medicaid Pricing:**
- Medicaid Best Price: Lowest price available to any purchaser
- Mandatory rebate: Minimum 23.1% for branded drugs, plus inflation adjustments
- Managed Medicaid may negotiate additional rebates
- State-specific formularies and restrictions

**Example:** Yescarta 340B Price = $223,800 (vs WAC $373,000 = 40% discount)

---

### 3. **Commercial Insurance Pricing**
**Definition:** Negotiated rates between pharmaceutical manufacturers and private insurance companies.

**How It Works:**
- Each insurer negotiates confidential rebates/discounts
- Net prices typically 20-35% below WAC
- Varies significantly by:
  - Insurance plan type (PPO, HMO, HDHP)
  - Formulary tier placement
  - Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) contracts
  - Market competition

**Commercial Insurance Types:**

**Medicare Part B (Medical Benefit):**
- Covers infused/injected therapies (CAR-T, infusion drugs)
- Typically pays Average Sales Price (ASP) + 6% to providers
- Patient responsibility: 20% coinsurance after Part B deductible ($240 in 2025)
- Supplemental insurance often covers the 20%

**Medicare Part D (Prescription Drug Benefit):**
- Covers oral medications (MS drugs, oral cancer drugs)
- Formulary-based coverage with tiers
- Patient cost-sharing varies by plan and phase:
  - Deductible phase: Up to $590 in 2025
  - Initial coverage: Copay/coinsurance per tier
  - Coverage gap: 25% coinsurance
  - Catastrophic: $0 or minimal copay after $8,000 out-of-pocket

**Private/Employer Insurance:**
- PPO/HMO plans: Formulary-based coverage
- High-deductible plans: Patient pays until deductible met
- Specialty pharmacy requirements common for high-cost drugs
- Typical cost-sharing: $50-$1,000+ per prescription depending on tier

**Example Pricing Scenarios:**
- Tecvayli Commercial: $240,000-264,000/year (varies by insurer)
- Patient with good commercial insurance: Might pay $100-5,000/year out-of-pocket
- Patient with high-deductible plan: Might pay $10,000+ until deductible met

---

### 4. **PAP (Patient Assistance Programs)**
**Definition:** Manufacturer-sponsored programs providing free or reduced-cost drugs to eligible patients.

**How PAPs Work:**
- Income-based eligibility (typically <400-600% of Federal Poverty Level)
- Insurance status requirements (uninsured, underinsured, or denied coverage)
- Application process through manufacturer or foundation
- Provides medication at no cost or minimal copay

**Types of Patient Support:**

**Copay Assistance Programs (Copay Cards):**
- For insured patients with commercial insurance
- Reduces or eliminates copay/coinsurance
- Annual maximums (typically $5,000-$25,000/year)
- NOT available for government insurance (illegal per Anti-Kickback Statute)
- Example: "Pay as little as $0" or "Maximum $10/month"

**Free Drug Programs:**
- For uninsured or underinsured patients
- Income verification required
- Application through manufacturer or foundations
- Provides medication at no cost if eligible

**Foundation Assistance:**
- Independent charitable foundations
- Disease-specific assistance (e.g., MS, cancer)
- Help with copays, insurance premiums, travel costs
- Examples: Patient Access Network Foundation, HealthWell Foundation

**Example:** 
- Ocrevus list price: $65,000/year
- Commercial insurance patient responsibility: $5,000/year
- With Genentech Copay Card: Reduced to $10/year (up to $15,000 assistance annually)

## Important Notes for Patients

1. **Never pay full price without exploring assistance:** Nearly every high-cost therapy has PAP options

2. **Prior authorization is standard:** Allow 2-4 weeks for PA processing before treatment start

3. **Copay accumulator programs:** Some insurers don't count manufacturer copay assistance toward deductibles - ask your plan

4. **Medicare patients:** Cannot use manufacturer copay cards, but foundations can help with 20% coinsurance

5. **Treatment timing:** Insurance benefits reset annually - timing treatment around benefit year can impact OOP costs

6. **Appeal denials:** If insurance denies, appeal immediately with physician support - most denials are overturned

7. **340B eligibility:** If you receive care at a 340B hospital/clinic, drug costs may be significantly lower
